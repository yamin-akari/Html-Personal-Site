      negotiated Burma's independence from the United Kingdom in 1947; he was
      assassinated by his rivals in the same year. She is a niece of Thakin Than

      Lin and Aung San Oo, in Rangoon. Aung San Lin died at the age of eight
      when he drowned in an ornamental lake on the grounds of the house.Her
      elder brother emigrated to San Diego, California, becoming a United States
